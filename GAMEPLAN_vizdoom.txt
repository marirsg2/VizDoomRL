==================================

For SML paper analysis

1) Vary Epsilon, and exploration time AGAINST the number of actions (8 vs 3) and see how long the optimal policy takes




==================================

@why is kframe CNN only not working ? ensure that the data is being fed in properly
NO SHUFFLE. Random sampling !! of the CNN frames . Size must be large enough to do this?

I STILL think repeating data in the batches may not be a good idea.feed in batch units, and don't repeat.
OR randomly sample 4 sequential frames for the CNN

@test the improved time distribution on the visual model. EVEN THIS, is probably missing some parts.

@apply the improved time distribution to the old stateful model as well !! review the memory management in that part.


Try batch size == 1. if you set it to be 64, then you update weights for the first 64 steps. Could cover 2 episodes.
REMOVE shuffle == false ?
