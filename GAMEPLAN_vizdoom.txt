==================================

For SML paper analysis

1) Vary Epsilon, and exploration time AGAINST the number of actions (8 vs 3) and see how long the optimal policy takes




==================================





A[i] -> A[i-1]  , because the image frames were only between  i-frames to i, which is frames BEFORE index i.
So you took the action after it. limited connection.
EXPLAINS why the lstm did NOTHING.

Why is //kframes making a huge difference






Instead of TEST BUFFER, for k-frames, we just add the current state to the prev 3 s1-states
DO THIS WITH k=1 first. Then see how performance changes for 2 frames, 3 frames and such.



Maybe the state space is not being properly captured, perhaps an autoencoder !! Is there a default autoencoder module? like resnet

@why is kframe CNN only not working ? ensure that the data is being fed in properly
NO SHUFFLE. Random sampling !! of the CNN frames . Size must be large enough to do this?

I STILL think repeating data in the batches may not be a good idea.feed in batch units, and don't repeat.
OR randomly sample 4 sequential frames for the CNN

@test the improved time distribution on the visual model. EVEN THIS, is probably missing some parts.

@apply the improved time distribution to the old stateful model as well !! review the memory management in that part.


Try batch size == 1. if you set it to be 64, then you update weights for the first 64 steps. Could cover 2 episodes.
REMOVE shuffle == false ?
