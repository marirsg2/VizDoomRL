==================================

For SML paper analysis

0) Separate code into memory model, and your part to be clear to teacher about what parts were taken.

1) Vary Epsilon, and exploration time AGAINST the number of actions (8 vs 3) and see how long the optimal policy takes

2) Talk about the importance of variance in tracking progress. Because some cases give very high value (monster in middle)
so the average can be misleading. Also training variance is a bad estimate because of the epsilon (exploration rate)




==================================


NEXT: in k1_test buff SLIGHT MOD TO.
BETTER TO REPEAT THE FIRST FRAME RATHER THAN ZEROS !!

DOUBLE CHECK if your exploration rate is set right.

VARY FRAME rate for larger frame searching

is s2 = none in terminal case gonna be a problem ?? in fitting?




I wonder if the additional frames really makes a difference. The actions are what is really important. IMAGINE
if you moved left, right, left, (random exploration), doesnt really mater for basic

==========================================================
Maybe the state space is not being properly captured, perhaps an autoencoder !! Is there a default autoencoder module? like resnet

@why is kframe CNN only not working ? ensure that the data is being fed in properly
NO SHUFFLE. Random sampling !! of the CNN frames . Size must be large enough to do this?

I STILL think repeating data in the batches may not be a good idea.feed in batch units, and don't repeat.
OR randomly sample 4 sequential frames for the CNN

@test the improved time distribution on the visual model. EVEN THIS, is probably missing some parts.

@apply the improved time distribution to the old stateful model as well !! review the memory management in that part.


Try batch size == 1. if you set it to be 64, then you update weights for the first 64 steps. Could cover 2 episodes.
REMOVE shuffle == false ?
